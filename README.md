# Customer-Churn-Reduction-For-Southeast-Airlines-

Taking airlines has been a more and more common and convenient way for people to travel around the US, a country which has a vast territory, huge population and increasingly large purchasing power, thus there is an important concern for an airline company to develop high quality of service by making improvements in their advertising, product and service features, value-added products and services, in their customersâ€™ ease of use, reliability and loyalty. By improving customer experience and reduce customer churn, Southeast Airlines would become more competitive and successful in the market.
With the fact that customers were valuing the loyalty program less, just relying on their loyalty program was not enough in keeping low customer churn, thus in this project, we try to extract valuable attributes and generate models to help analyze other important influencers that companies should pay attention to.
